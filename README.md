This project demonstrates the use of CSS Flexbox for creating responsive web layouts. It includes examples and detailed explanations of how to use flex containers and flex items to build flexible and adaptive user interfaces. The live demo showcases various configurations and properties that can be applied to flex containers and their child elements to achieve different layout behaviors.


## Features

- **Flex Containers:** Examples of how to define flex containers using `display: flex` and `display: inline-flex`.
- **Flex Items:** Demonstrations of flex item properties such as `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, `align-self`, and `order`.
- **Alignment:** Techniques for aligning flex items using `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `align-content`.
- **Flex Direction:** Usage of `flex-direction` to change the flow of items in a flex container.
- **Wrapping:** Applying `flex-wrap` to manage how flex items wrap onto multiple lines.
- **Responsive Design:** Creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using media queries in combination with flex properties.
